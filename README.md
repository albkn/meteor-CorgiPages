# meteor-CorgiPages
App for small businesses to easily create their own business site just by using their Facebook data.

## The idea
This app was built by [Albert Kurniawan](https://github.com/kAlbert19), [Pasha Rayan](https://github.com/pasharayan), and [Erick Wu](https://github.com/erickchaosz) in less than 24 hrs for Facebook's Sydney Hackathon 2015. Built for small businesses in mind, this app fetches data from a small business' FB page (through FB Graph API) and generates a simple business page with an AI concierge. 

## Is it live?
[umm yes, for demo purposes](https://corgipages.meteor.com)

## The corgi
The corgi image is borrowed from a very talented designer [Alexey Kuvaldin](https://dribbble.com/shots/2024231-Corgi?list=shots&sort=popular&timeframe=now&offset=8). The corgi has been supercharged with our Wit.ai instance that has been trained for less than 120 minutes. It can now differentiate between address questions, booking requests, and opening hours questions.

## The tech
Meteor for backend, FB Graph API for fetching data, Wit.ai for Natural Language Processing.

## Maintainability
The codebase is small and pretty maintainable, but we made the app just for the hackathon and therefore have no plans to develop or maintain it further.
